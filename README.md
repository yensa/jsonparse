JsonParse
=========

JsonParse is a simple Json Lexer and Parser implemented in rust.

The goal of this project is to learn to get familiar with the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) programming language.

The lexer and parser implementation follows [RFC4627](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4627) as much as possible.

Right now only the Lexing part is implemented and still has some shortcomings to be fixed in the future.

TODO
-----

* Add support to the lexer for floating point numbers
* Improve string support for the lexer
* Implement the Parser part and generate a clean AST
* Improve Error handling
* Write some tests to check the behavior
